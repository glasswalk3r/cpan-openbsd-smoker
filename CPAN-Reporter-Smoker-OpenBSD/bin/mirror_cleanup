=head1 DESCRIPTION

The main objective of this program is to reduce the size of storage required to have a L<CPAN> local repository.

This program assumes that the same user that has a mirror setup with L<CPAN::Mini> is running it.

Also, it expects that the user has the L<CPAN> client configured to use a SQLite backend.

It will run over all the distributions available on the database, and check the corresponding directories on the mirror
(right now hardcoded to C</minicpan/authors/id/> but may change in the future): if there is any tarball that is not 
listed as the most current distribution for an author, it will be removed.

At this moment, it is unclear why those older distribution are still available, but when it does it is not for any particular distribution. It might be a
problem with the mirror itself.

Nevertheless, since the mirror is intended to be used for L<CPAN::Reporter::Smoker> and that only the most recent distribution
matters, it will release some storage space.

=head1 CAVEATS

This program should be considered experimental, may be there unknown side effects.
