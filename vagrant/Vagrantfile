  Remember to execute the following manual steps after provisioning is finished:
    1 - Configure passwords for the new users with 'passwd'. Change the default password of vagrant user, same thing for root.
    2 - Spend some time validating tests results. Tests will not be submitted automatically, but saved to a local directory before submission. This will give you a chance to validate the smoker configuration first.
    3 - Once everything is fine, start the metabase-relayd application with the vagrant user.
    4 - With the new users, start the smoker with the alias 'start_smoker'.
    5 - Submit reports with the script 'send_reports'. Check out it's documentation with 'perldoc send_reports'. Skip reports with "unknown" grade until you're sure the errors weren't caused by the smoker itself.
    6 - If some distribution halts the smoker, block it with 'dblock'. Check out it's documentation with 'perldoc dblock'.
