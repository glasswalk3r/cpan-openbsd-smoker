  Remember to execute the following manual steps after provisioning is finished:
    1 - Configure passwords for the new users with 'passwd'. Change the default
    password of your defined user, vagrant user and root.
    2 - Run the program /usr/local/bin/smoker_install with the chosen user to
    install the smoker for that user. This setup will already generate testing
    reports that will be stored at the $HOME/ready_reports directory.
    3 - Spend some time validating tests results. Tests will not be submitted
    automatically, but saved to a local directory before submission. This will
    give you a chance to validate the smoker configuration before submission.
    4 - Submit reports with the script 'send_reports'. Check out it's
    documentation with 'perldoc send_reports'. Skip reports with "unknown" grade
    until you're sure the errors weren't caused by the smoker itself.
    5 - If some distribution halts the smoker, block it with 'dblock'. Check out
    it's documentation with 'perldoc dblock'.
